Read a full line, then parse it element by element. To read the line:

    std::string line;
    std::getline(cin, line);

To parse it, create a std::istringstream and read from that:

    std::istringstream in(line);
    int val;
    while (in >> val) {
        // whatever
    }

And when the loop exits, check why it exited:

    if (in.eof())
        // got through the full line, hit end of file
    else
        // stopped short, because something was wrong with the input
